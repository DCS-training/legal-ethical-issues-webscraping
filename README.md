# Legal & Ethical Issues in Web Scraping
A workshop covering the legal and ethical factors to consider when web scraping in research contexts.

## Getting ready
This is a beginner-level event, and no previous knowledge of the method is required. Bring your laptop, your charger, and your questions about web scraping and ethical data collection. 

## Overview
The application programming interfaces (APIs) of major social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit are being closed or restricted, potentially cutting off access to a significant data source about online social interaction. Does this mean the end of research using social media data in the social sciences and humanities? Not necessarily! Researchers have persevered, continuing to acquire data from social media platforms using web scraping. However, such research can be controversial, and researchers using web scraping have occasionally faced backlash from both social media platforms and the public. There is, therefore, a need for researchers to understand how web scraping can be conducted legally and ethically in order to continue studying social media in a post-API era. As a first step, this course introduces students to the legal and ethical issues involved with web scraping. 

First, we discuss key issues, including terms of service (ToS) violations, copyright, privacy, notice and consent, public vs. private data, and data sharing. Next, we discuss controversial cases of research using web scraping, the techniques they used, and why they were controversial. Finally, we invite discussion about what legal and ethical web scraping might look like, and how students can apply these lessons to their own projects.
